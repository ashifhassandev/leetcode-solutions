# 206. Reverse Linked List

<br>  

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

<br>  

Example 1:

Input: head = \[1,2,3,4,5] <br>
Output: \[5,4,3,2,1]

Example 2:

Input: head = \[1,2] <br>
Output: \[2,1]

Example 3:

Input: head = \[] <br>
Output: \[]

<br>  

Constraints:

* The number of nodes in the list is in the range \[0, 5000].
* -5000 <= Node.val <= 5000

<br>  

Follow-up:
A linked list can be reversed either **iteratively** or **recursively**. Could you implement both?
