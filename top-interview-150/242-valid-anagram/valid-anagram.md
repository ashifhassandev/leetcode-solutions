# 242. Valid Anagram

<br>

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return **true** if `t` is an **anagram** of `s`, and **false** otherwise.

An **anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

<br>

Example 1:

Input: `s = "anagram"`, `t = "nagaram"` <br>
Output: `true`

Example 2:

Input: `s = "rat"`, `t = "car"` <br>
Output: `false`

<br>

Constraints:

* 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 × 10⁴
* `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

What if the inputs contain **Unicode** characters? How would you adapt your solution to handle such cases efficiently?
